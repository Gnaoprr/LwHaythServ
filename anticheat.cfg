// 
// Lightweight HaythServ - anticheat.cfg
// 
// This is a basic cheater detection, it is very configurable
// and it should be pretty secure, if you are just looking
// for a lightweight configuration, set securitylevel to 1,
// and just toggle on some cheat detections (like edithack,
// ffa weapons in instagib, etc...) if you have a good server,
// and you are sure it can hold good protections with many
// checks, set securitylevel to 9 and toggle all cheater
// detections on.
//

// 
// Configuration
// 
// Security level
// This is the securitylevel of the anticheat, set it to a
// high value, if you're server is good and can afford much
// checks, set it to a lower value, if you want a lightweight
// performance. Minimal value for securitylevel is 1, maximal
// value is 9, 3 is default value.
// securitylevel 3

// 
// What cheats to check for
//
// Here you can set what cheats to check for with the anticheat,
// toggle all cheat detections Ã³n, if you want a better protection,
// toggle just some cheat detections on, if you want a good and
// lightweight performance.

// Wether the server checks for ffa guns in instagib or not
// ffaweaponsininstagib 1

// Wether the server checks for editmode in non coop edit or not
// editmodeinnoncoop 1

// Whether the server checks for no send position hack or not
// this function has not been tested yet, but we already tested
// that it doesn't ban people randomly, I'm just not sure if
// it'll ban people with no send position hack
// nosendposition 1

// Whether the server checks for speed hack by ping checking or not
// this function is disabled at the moment, because it is not working
// correctly, it bans people randomly, it's just to fix
// speedhackping 1

// Whether the server checks for edit packets in non coop edit or not
// editpacketsinnoncoop 0

// Whether the server checks for unknown sound messages or not
// unknownsound 0

// Whether the server checks for wrong messages size or not
// wrongmessagesize 0

// Whether the server checks for ping hack or not
// toggle this only on, if you want to ban people who uses ping hack,
// ping hack is very harmless, and that's why it's set to 0. Just toggle
// this on if you are really sure about banning people for harmless ping
// hacking
// pinghack 0
